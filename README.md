# IMG2IMG_Stable_Diffusion
This code uses PyTorch and the Hugging Face Diffusers library to transform an input image based on a text prompt using a pre-trained image-to-image model (digiplay/Realisian_v5). It takes an image, applies the prompt and generates a modified image by blending features of the prompt and the original.
